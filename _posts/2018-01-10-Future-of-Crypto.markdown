Bitcoins, Ethereum, and Litecoin are all different types of cryptocurrencies that are evolving everyday. There has been an increase in media coverage over these alternative types of currencies. Is now the time to invest or is now the time to jump ship? 

### Volatility
It has been no surprise that many senior investors have sheered away from investing in the cryptocoin market. An example like Bitcoin with prices skyrocketing in 2017. With starting prices beginning at \$4,000 (USD) and peak prices as high as \$18,000 (USD). As to be expected, many have reported triple returns on their investments. Near the end of 2017 there was a major decline in price about %20, probably because investors are expecting some regulations coming in 2018. 

As a seasoned investor, that much volatility in the market could give one many sleepless nights. So the question begs, is it too late to invest in digital currency?  

### Do I invest in digital currency?

Our answer is yes, but we would stay away from Bitcoin. One of the main fundamental flaws with Bitcoin are their **transaction times**. In order for one to buy a certain amount of Bitcoin it takes about 15 minutes to complete one transaction. On top of that, the transaction fees are approximately \$28 on average. One could be paying a \$16 fee for their \$25 worth of Bitcoin. 

With this being said, there have been many solutions to solve this problem with continual updates and forks. (Later articles to describe this) One of the main solution was creating derivatives of Bitcoin such as Ethereum and Litecoin. 

### If not Bitcoin, what should I invest in?

The keyword is **invest**. People are not buying and selling with this as they do with the current dollar down at the coffee shop due to the excessive wait times and transaction fees. 

In the future we will see this, but with the current code fluctuations and how dynamically things are changing, we speculate that Ethereum and Litecoin will gain much more popularity. Due to its dynamic and robust code base. 

Many experts have show that Bitcoin leads the pack, but as more coders are moving their talents to maintain other types of coins; It will be no surprise if Bitcoin stabilizes around \$11,000 in price per coin. 


What are your thoughts on where the cryptocoin market is headed?
