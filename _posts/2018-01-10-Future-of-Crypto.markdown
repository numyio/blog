Bitcoins, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others that are evolving everyday. The hype and spin of cryptocoins is definitely a the buzz. 



### Volatility
It has been no surprise that many investors have sheered away from investing in the cryptocoin market. Bitcoin in 2017 has seen quite a turn of events. With starting prices beginning at 4,000 (USD) and price increases as high as 18,000 (USD), many have reported triple returns on their investments.


Actually many investors all together shaming the idea of a crypto-world. There have even been some bank [CEO's][chase] even discrediting them all together. 

## Do I invest in digital currency?

My answer is yes, but I would stay away from Bitcoin. One of the main fundamental flaws with Bitcoin are their transaction times. In order for one to buy a certain amount of Bitcoin it takes about 15 minutes to complete one transaction. On top of that, the transaction fee are approximately $28 on average. One could be paying $16 fee for their $25 worth of Bitcoin. 

## If not bitcoin, what should I invest in?

The keyword is invest. People are not buying and selling with this as they do with the current dollar down at the coffee shop due to the excessive wait times and transaction fees.
